## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧩 [Habit Tracker](https://github.com/LeonHarb/habit-tracker) – Cloud-Native Web App
**Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL  
- Developed a collaborative full-stack web application that enables teams to create, track, and manage daily habits and tasks
- Built the backend using Java Spring Boot, integrated a PostgreSQL database via Spring Data JPA/Hibernate
- Implemented secure RESTful APIs for user authentication and CRUD operations
- Designed an interactive HTML, CSS, JavaScript frontend that communicates with the backend through API calls
- Containerized the system using Docker and deployed it via Kubernetes on Chameleon Cloud for scalability and portability
- Collaborated with a team of three using Git/GitHub for version control and task management
 

### ⚙️ [UltraGPS](https://github.com/LeonHarb/UltraGPS-Indoor-Localization-System) – Indoor Localization System
**Tech Stack:** Arduino, C++, MATLAB, SolidWorks  
- Developed an indoor localization system for an RTK mini-tractor using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors, enabling real-time tracking in GPS-denied environments across 4 high-schools robotics programs
- Programmed synchronization and Time-of-flight routines in C++, ensuring consistent, low-latency data across 6 receiver nodes
- Implemented real-time position tracking in MATLAB, achieving ±2 cm accuracy and stable 5 Hz update rates
- Designed the transmitter tower, receiver mounts, and enclosures in SolidWorks, optimizing rapid setup and portability
- Reduced calibration time by 80% (10 → 2 minutes) through algorithm and UI improvements in calibration software
